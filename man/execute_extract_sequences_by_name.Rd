\usage{
execute_extract_sequences_by_name(
  entity,
  pattern,
  fields = c("gene", "locus_tag", "product"),
  options = list()
)
}
\arguments{
\item{entity}{A genome_entity object}

\item{pattern}{Character string or regex pattern to match feature names}

\item{fields}{Character vector of fields to search (default: c("gene", "locus_tag", "product"))}

\item{options}{List of options:
\itemize{
\item ignore_case: Logical, case-insensitive matching (default TRUE)
\item type_filter: Character, filter by feature type (e.g., "CDS", "gene")
\item translate: Logical, translate CDS to protein (default FALSE)
}}
}
\value{
Named character vector of sequences
}
\description{
Internal use case for extracting DNA sequences for features matching a pattern.
Searches features by gene name, locus_tag, or product and extracts
their sequences from the genome.

This is an internal function called by the controller extract_sequences_by_name().
Users should use the controller function instead.
