\title{Export Functions for Genome Data}
\description{
Functions for exporting genome data to various formats (FASTA, GFF3).
In Clean Architecture terms, these handle output formatting and file writing.

Note: In Phase 6, these functions remain in R/genbank_export.R and are used by
R/controllers/export_controller.R. Some of this logic could be moved to use cases
and presenters for full Clean Architecture compliance in future phases.
