\title{Export Functions for Genome Data}
\description{
Functions for exporting genome data to FASTA and GFF3 formats.

\strong{IMPORTANT}: Despite the filename "genbank_export.R", this file does NOT
contain GenBank export functionality. GenBank export is FORBIDDEN (not just
unimplemented) because:
\enumerate{
\item GenBank requires rich metadata (organism, taxonomy, references) that
GFF3+FASTA format does not contain
\item Converting GFF3+FASTA to GenBank would produce incomplete/invalid files
\item This violates the one-way conversion rule: GenBank → GFF3+FASTA only
}

\strong{NO \code{write_genbank()} FUNCTION WILL BE IMPLEMENTED.}

This file contains FASTA and GFF3 export functions only.

Note: In Clean Architecture terms, these functions handle output formatting
and file writing. They remain in R/genbank_export.R and are used by
R/controllers/export_controller.R. Some of this logic could be moved to use
cases and presenters for full Clean Architecture compliance in future phases.
