\title{Write Features to GFF3 File}
\usage{
write_gff3(x, file, source = "micromicon", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A genome_entity object}

\item{file}{Output file path}

\item{source}{Character; source field for GFF3 (default "micromicon")}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the file path
}
\description{
Export features from a genome_entity to GFF3 format.

\strong{⚠️ METADATA LOSS}: If the genome was imported from GenBank, this export
will LOSE organism information, taxonomic lineage, references, comments,
and accession numbers. GFF3 format cannot represent GenBank metadata.

\strong{❌ NO REVERSE CONVERSION}: GFF3+FASTA cannot be converted back to GenBank.
No \code{write_genbank()} function exists - this is FORBIDDEN, not a missing feature.

\details{
\subsection{What Gets Preserved}{
\itemize{
\item Feature coordinates (start, end, strand)
\item Feature types (gene, CDS, tRNA, etc.)
\item Gene names, products, locus tags
}
}

\subsection{What Gets LOST (from GenBank sources)}{
\itemize{
\item Organism name and taxonomic lineage
\item References and publication citations
\item Comments and curator notes
\item Accession numbers and version history
\item Sequence topology (circular vs. linear)
}
}

\subsection{Why GenBank Export is FORBIDDEN}{

There is no reverse conversion (GFF3+FASTA → GenBank) because:
\itemize{
\item GFF3+FASTA lacks the metadata required for valid GenBank files
\item GenBank format requires organism, taxonomy, and reference information
\item Creating incomplete GenBank files would violate NCBI format specifications
}

\examples{
\dontrun{
genome <- read_genome("data.gbk")
write_gff3(genome, "output.gff3")
}
