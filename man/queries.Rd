\title{Unified Query Functions (Backward Compatibility)}
\description{
This file provides backward-compatible query functions for genome data.
These functions are thin wrappers around the Clean Architecture controller implementations
located in R/controllers/query_controller.R.

In Phase 6 of the Clean Architecture refactoring, these functions were moved to the
Interface Adapters layer (controllers). This file exists for documentation and to
maintain the historical API surface.
