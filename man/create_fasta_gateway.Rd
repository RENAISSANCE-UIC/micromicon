\title{Create FASTA Gateway}
\usage{
create_fasta_gateway(use_bioconductor = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{use_bioconductor}{Logical; if TRUE and Biostrings is available, use it
for reading/writing. Default TRUE.}
}
\value{
Gateway object (list with read and write methods)
}
\description{
Creates a gateway for reading and writing FASTA format files. This gateway
provides optional Bioconductor integration for enhanced performance and features.

Gateway Contract (for use cases):
\itemize{
\item read(path): Returns named character vector where names are sequence IDs
and values are DNA sequences
\item write(sequences, path): Writes sequences to FASTA file
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
gateway <- create_fasta_gateway()
sequences <- gateway$read("genome.fasta")
gateway$write(sequences, "output.fasta")
}
}
