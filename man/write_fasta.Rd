\title{Write Sequences to FASTA File}
\usage{
write_fasta(x, file, wrap_width = 80, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A genome_entity object or named character vector}

\item{file}{Output file path}

\item{wrap_width}{Integer; wrap sequences at this width (default 80)}

\item{...}{Additional arguments (currently unused)}
}
\value{
Invisibly returns the file path
}
\description{
Export sequences from a genome_entity or character vector to FASTA format.

\strong{⚠️ METADATA LOSS}: If the genome was imported from GenBank, this export
will LOSE organism information, taxonomic lineage, references, comments,
and accession numbers. FASTA format only stores sequence IDs and sequences.

\strong{❌ NO REVERSE CONVERSION}: GFF3+FASTA cannot be converted back to GenBank.
No \code{write_genbank()} function exists - this is FORBIDDEN, not a missing feature.

\details{
\subsection{What Gets Preserved}{
\itemize{
\item Sequence IDs (from seqnames)
\item DNA sequences
}
}

\subsection{What Gets LOST (from GenBank sources)}{
\itemize{
\item Organism name and taxonomic lineage
\item References and publication citations
\item Comments and curator notes
\item Accession numbers and version history
\item Sequence topology (circular vs. linear)
\item All feature annotations (genes, CDS, etc.)
}
}

\subsection{Why GenBank Export is FORBIDDEN}{

There is no reverse conversion (GFF3+FASTA → GenBank) because:
\itemize{
\item GFF3+FASTA lacks the metadata required for valid GenBank files
\item GenBank format requires organism, taxonomy, and reference information
\item Creating incomplete GenBank files would violate NCBI format specifications
}
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
genome <- read_genome("data.gbk")

# Export all sequences
write_fasta(genome, "output.fasta")

# Export specific sequences
seqs <- sequences(genome)
write_fasta(seqs[1:5], "subset.fasta")
}
}
