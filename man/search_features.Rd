\title{Search Features}
\usage{
search_features(x, ...)

search_features(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object to search}

\item{...}{Additional arguments}

\item{type}{Character; filter by feature type (e.g., "gene", "CDS")}

\item{pattern}{Character string to search for in feature annotations.
Searches across ID, Name, Alias, gene, locus_tag, and product fields
(case-insensitive). Compatible with various GFF3 annotation sources
including breseq, Prokka, and NCBI.}

\item{seqname}{Character; filter by sequence name}

\item{start}{Integer; filter features starting after this position}

\item{end}{Integer; filter features ending before this position}

\item{strand}{Character; filter by strand ("+", "-")}
}
\value{
data.frame of matching features
}
\description{
Search for features matching criteria (type, name, coordinates).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
genome <- read_genome("data.gbk")

# Find all genes
genes <- search_features(genome, type = "gene")

# Find CDS on chr1
cds_chr1 <- search_features(genome, type = "CDS", seqname = "chr1")

# Find features matching pattern
dna_features <- search_features(genome, pattern = "dna")
}
