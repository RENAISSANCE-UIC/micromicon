\title{Converter Functions (Transformation Layer)}
\description{
Functions for converting between different genome data representations.
In Clean Architecture terms, these are transformation use cases.

Note: In Phase 6, these functions remain in R/converters.R but should
eventually be moved to R/use_cases/transform/ for full Clean Architecture
compliance. They are used by controllers and other parts of the system.
