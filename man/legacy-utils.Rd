\title{Legacy Utility Functions}
\description{
Legacy utility functions from the original codebase. These are maintained for
backward compatibility but should not be used in new code.

Note: The library() calls have been removed. Package dependencies are managed
through DESCRIPTION file (Imports/Suggests). Functions that require specific
packages should use requireNamespace() to check availability.
