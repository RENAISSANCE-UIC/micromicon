\title{I/O Functions for Genome Data (Backward Compatibility)}
\description{
This file provides backward-compatible I/O functions for reading genome data.
These functions are thin wrappers around the Clean Architecture controller implementations
located in R/controllers/import_controller.R.

In Phase 6 of the Clean Architecture refactoring, these functions were moved to the
Interface Adapters layer (controllers). This file exists for documentation and to
maintain the historical API surface.
