Description: A unified genomics toolkit implementing clean architecture principles
    for working with GenBank and GFF3/FASTA data. Provides a common genome_entity
    object that bridges lightweight R data structures with optional Bioconductor
    integration. Features include format conversion, sequence extraction, feature
    queries, and graceful degradation when Bioconductor is unavailable. The Clean
    architecture design ensures testability, maintainability, and framework
    independence.
